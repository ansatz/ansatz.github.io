# bayesian truth serum
- question and k-multiple choice  
  elicit, responder answer x_r + prediction of group_y
 
- suprisingly uncommon
  	-- personal estimate `x_r` is higher, n=1
  	-- group estimate `y_j` is lower, underestimated
  	-- if $x_r < y_j$ then `su`
	-- true x_r is best guess of `su` candidates

- payoff function
	-- responder-score = $w_\theta * log(P(x)/P(y)) * entropy_KL-diverge factor$ 

- bayes equilibrium
	-- truthful answer, max responder-score
