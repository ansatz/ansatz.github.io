- litmus test: `fun` because you are ready, for work or sleep
- 2 components circadian, homeostatic  
	- circadian: tendency to maintain sleep , go to sleep at time when drowsy, not before or later
	- homeostatic: more you work/learn.. more tendency to fall asleep (sleep inertia) +15-19 hrs after wake
	- sleep inertia --can only feel as grogginess when wake up, not good
- only thing can control is sleep inertia, ie how quickly fall asleep, how quickly wake up
